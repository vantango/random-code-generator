# Random Code Generator

## Project Description
For this assignment, I was tasked with creating a random code generator that required the user to choose a minimum of one character type and a password length between 8 and 128 characters. If either requirement isn't met, it alerts the user that to start over and make choices for their password that will meet both requirments.

### Table of Contents

#### Technologies Used
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS

#### Processes
* Utilizing the pre=existing HTML/CSS files and JavaScript starter code, I created a function to house the entire sequence.
* Created variables that present the user with a series of confirmations/prompts for their password criteria choices.
* Created conditionals that require the user to adhere to the two password generator requirements.
* Created variables for the arrays consisting of all of the characters for each character type.
* Implemented a loop that runs through multiple conditionals that generate randomized characters based on character types and password length chosen.
* The randomly generated characters are pushed into an empty array, which returns them and pushes to the user.
